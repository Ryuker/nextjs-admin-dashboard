# 1. Setup
## Creating a new Next app with Tailwind installed
```Terminal client
npx create-next-app@latest --tailwind
```

# 2. Install Shadcn/UI and initialize
```Terminal client
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

- running the above command adds Shadcn/ui but also a components.json file
  - this is for configuration.
